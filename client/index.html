      <h2>Early Intervention</h2>
      <p>Early intervention is crucial for children with developmental delays or disabilities. By identifying and addressing challenges early on, we can provide targeted support that helps children develop essential skills. Our approach ensures children receive the necessary therapies to enhance their cognitive, physical, and emotional growth during their formative years.</p>

      <h2>Behavioral Support</h2>
      <p>Behavioral support is designed to help children with behavioral challenges, particularly those associated with autism or developmental disorders. Through a combination of behavioral analysis, structured interventions, and family support, we work to improve social skills, reduce disruptive behaviors, and foster positive interactions. Our goal is to build self-confidence and independence.</p>

      <h2>Speech Therapy</h2>
      <p>Speech therapy plays a vital role in helping children develop effective communication skills. Whether addressing speech delays, articulation problems, or language comprehension, our therapists use individualized techniques to improve both verbal and non-verbal communication. This enhances a child’s ability to express themselves, interact with peers, and succeed academically.</p>

      <h2>Occupational Therapy</h2>
      <p>Occupational therapy focuses on developing the skills needed for everyday activities. For children with disabilities or developmental delays, tasks such as writing, dressing, or using utensils can be challenging. Our therapists help children improve motor skills, sensory processing, and fine motor coordination, allowing them to gain independence and perform daily tasks with confidence.</p>
